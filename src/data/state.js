    owner: {
      name: "Andre LeBlanc",
      background: "The owner, Andre LeBlanc, began developing his passion for carpentry and construction at age 14. He was employed every summer during high school for a licensed builder, honing his skill set in carpentry. He went on to receive a degree in Construction Management. After graduating college, Andre acquired his real estate license and spent a few years working in the industry so that he could develop a full understanding of the residential housing market.\n He enjoyed helping individuals with the process of purchasing or selling their homes. He knew he would be working in construction, and he continued to build the knowledge and skills to succeed from all angles. For several years, he worked as a lead carpenter for a company that focused on timber framing and historical restoration. In New England, a large percentage of homes, are built pre-1900, and this niche specialty is an integral part of what makes Andre’s background unique. Growing up in Vermont, on a family-run farm, Andre naturally wanted to get involved and understand how older houses and barns were constructed at that time. He enjoys working with reclaimed lumber and timber framed houses or barns when the opportunity arises. Andre has combined his unique experience, passion, and artistry together as one to form New England Home Restoration."

        question: "Why are some contractors so much less expensive than others?",
        answer: "Not all contractors are created equal. Many people pose as \”contractors” who are actually unlicensed, uninsured, and/or use illegal labor. In addition, these \"contractors\" tend to use subpar materials and poor craftsmanship. If you are hiring a contractor, check their license, their insurance, and call their references (we are more than happy to supply these to you). Protect yourself. Hire a licensed, bonded, and insured contractor.\n More often than not, you get what you pay for. A good contractor provides quality input when you meet to discuss your plans. The good ones will help you realize your dreams. The bad ones will merely take down your ideas, itemize the list, add prices and ask for your signature.. and your cash. What you want is the contractor who does a thorough inspection, demonstrates knowledge of what is needed and what the options are. Never assume that all contractors know the latest building technologies, products and code requirements. You want the industry leader not the follower. At New England Home Restoration we pride ourselves on staying up to date on new products, technologies, and techniques.",

        question: "How much will my home improvement cost?",
        answer: "Projects vary widely depending on your needs and budget. New England Home Restoration’s owner, Andre LeBlanc, will visit with you to better understand your home improvement needs. At New England Home Restorations we do more than give you a quote. We provide you with the information you need to make the right decisions for your home. We take time to explain the details regarding your project’s design options and cost. We answer all of your questions and explain the estimates for your home improvement project.

        question: "Will there be a big mess during our project?",
        answer: "We respect your property by using all means to keep your home as clean and dust free as possible; these include drop cloths, furniture covers, ram boards, and BuildClean HEPA air scrubber. The BuildClean unit eliminates 90% of airborne dust and the air that it does clean is expelled outside and is not re-circulated.",

      },
      {
        question: "How long will my project take?",
        answer: "Once we have your order in hand, we begin production planning. Andre and the designers involved will first schedule a visit to your home to confirm the measurements and quantities needed for ordering materials. Work specifications for each trade skill are broken down into separate work orders. Purchase orders are prepared and sent to each vendor supplying the materials. Once the work is started on your home, it is our company’s policy to proceed to completion. It is important to each homeowner to understand that our concern is much the same as yours; the successful completion of your project in a timely and clean manner.",

      {
        question: "When will the project be completed?",
        answer: "Our company provides clients with a schedule before construction begins which includes a project completion deadline. Changes made by the Owner, unforeseen circumstances (such as weather delays or concealed conditions) may add time to the overall schedule; however, the schedule will be updated and redistributed when a delay occurs so that all parties are aware of the changes. The project is completed with the final walk through with Andre at which time the final payment is expected.",

        question: "What products do you like to use the most in kitchens and bathrooms?",
        answer: "At New England Home Restorations, we really enjoy using Wedi. It is a family owned company that offers waterproof and directly tileable building panels. It is lightweight, easy to work with and best of all, creates zero dust, unlike other products available. Andre is a certified Wedi installer and takes pleasure in the opportunity to discuss how Wedi products can be used in kitchens and bathrooms.",
